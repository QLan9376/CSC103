# CSC104project

-Everyone should sign up on bitbucket.
-Designate one member of your team to be the leader / repository owner. (They’ll set up the repository and grant access to the rest of the team.)
 Commits from the team members can be incorporated in one of two ways:
-Follow the instructions on collaborating with git. (Team leaders: don’t forget to give other members write access to the repository.)
-Use bitbucket’s fork + pull request features.
